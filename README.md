# USDX-Python-Lyric-Timer
This should be a clone of the Ultrastar Creation Tool called Songeasy, it has a few additional functionalities, but lacks refinement. I created it to have a native option for Mac Os.


# Usage
Execute the Main.py and put in all the necessary information. (The lyric input uses the F-key on the keyboard.) 

If needed install all the necessary packages like pygame, yt-dlp etc.
